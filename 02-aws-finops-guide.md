The service analyzes CloudWatch metrics to identify over-provisioned instances, suggesting optimal instance types that can reduce costs by **10-30%** while maintaining performance requirements.

**Implementation Process:**

1. Enable Compute Optimizer across your organization through AWS Organizations
2. Ensure comprehensive visibility
3. Review machine type recommendations considering both performance requirements and pricing models
4. Evaluate Spot, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans options

**Results:**
• Organizations report average savings of **25%** through systematic rightsizing implementation
• Some achieve up to **40%** reduction in compute costs for development environments

### Strategic commitment discount planning

The 2024 landscape presents a nuanced choice between Reserved Instances and Savings Plans. AWS introduced a **7-day return window** for Savings Plans in March 2024, providing flexibility for organizations to adjust commitments.

**Discount Comparison:**
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Discount Type   │ Savings Range   │ Flexibility     │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Reserved        │ Up to 72%       │ Low             │
│ Instances       │                 │                 │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Savings Plans   │ Up to 65%       │ High            │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Optimal Strategy:**
• Reserved Instances for core infrastructure with predictable usage patterns
• Savings Plans for dynamic workloads requiring flexibility
• Spot Instances for fault-tolerant batch processing

**Results:**
• Organizations typically achieve **20-75%** savings through strategic commitment purchases
